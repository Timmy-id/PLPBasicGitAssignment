# PLPBasicGitAssignment

### Steps used in this assignment

1. Created a new repository and initialized it with a README.md file
2. Created a folder, PLPBasicGitAssignment using the ```mkdir``` command on the terminal
3. Initialized it as a git repository using ```git init```
4. I linked the local repository to the remote repository using
    ```git remote add origin https://github.com/Timmy-id/PLPBasicGitAssignment.git```
5. Created a new file, hello.txt and added some texts in it
6. Then, I added the file to the staging area and committed it using
    ```git add``` and ```git commit -m "commit message"```
7. Then I renamed the branch to main as it was named master using ```git branch -m master main```
8. I had to make the local repository same as the remote repository by using 
    ```git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories```
9. Then, I pushed the code to GitHub using ```git push```
